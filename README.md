# ViewComponent Example App

A Rails application demonstrating how to build reusable UI components using ViewComponent to create maintainable, consistent, and scalable user interfaces.

## What This Demonstrates

• **Component-Based Architecture**: Shows how to break down complex UI patterns into reusable ViewComponents (like PageTitleComponent) that eliminate code duplication and ensure consistency across views

• **Rails View Refactoring**: Demonstrates the transformation from traditional Rails partials and helpers to modern, testable components that encapsulate both logic and presentation

• **Developer Experience**: Illustrates how ViewComponent improves maintainability by centralizing UI patterns, making changes easier to implement and reducing the likelihood of inconsistencies across the application
